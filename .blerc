# If ble/contrib/integration/fzf cannot find the fzf directory, please set the

# "/path/to/fzf-directory" should be replaced by a path to the fzf directory
# such as "$HOME/.fzf" or "/usr/share/fzf" that contain

#_ble_contrib_fzf_base=/path/to/fzf-directory


# Note: If you would like to combine fzf-completion with bash_completion, you
# need to load bash_completion earlier than fzf-completion.
